# Paste by Keyboard

### A simple script for pasting in applications that don't allow clipboard using your keyboard. 

#

#### **The script doesn't make any effort to hide itself and might get you in trouble if you use it in services that disallow third party apps such as this. I warned you and take no responsibility for any misusage of the script whatsoever.**

## **How to use**

- Unpack the distribution
- Use ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``v`` to paste
- Use ``esc`` to exit the script
- (optional) Make a shortcut for ```Paste by Keyboard.exe```
