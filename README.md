# Paste by Keyboard

### A simple script for pasting in applications that don't allow clipboard pasting, using your keyboard.

## **How to use**

- Unpack the distribution and run the executable
- Use ``ctrl`` + ``shift`` + ``v`` to paste
- Use ``esc`` to exit the script
- (optional) Make a shortcut for ```Paste by Keyboard.exe```
#### **If the script doesn't launch just enable it through Windows Security and you're good to go.**
